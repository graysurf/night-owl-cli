# 🌙 Night Owl CLI Theme Suite

A fully synchronized CLI color theme based on the famous **Night Owl** palette, redesigned for **low-light, high-focus terminal environments**.

This project brings Night Owl's signature cool tones and soft contrasts to your favorite command-line tools, including:

- 🐙 `delta` – Git diff viewer
- 🐱 `bat` – Syntax-highlighting cat replacement
- 📡 `k9s` – Kubernetes TUI client
- 🧬 `fzf` – Fuzzy finder with preview integration
- 🗂️ `lsd` – Modern `ls` with icon and color support
- 🔮 `iterm2` – Terminal emulator color scheme
- 🧪 `tmux` – Status line and pane border theming
- 🚀 `starship` – Minimal prompt with semantic color cues

## 🎯 Philosophy
> Night Owl is more than a theme — it’s a workspace ritual.

- Optimized for **focus** and **clarity** in low-light environments
- Reduces eye strain without sacrificing syntax readability
- Carefully selected saturation and brightness levels per tool
