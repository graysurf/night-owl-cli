# üåô Night Owl CLI Theme Suite

A fully synchronized CLI color theme based on the famous **Night Owl** palette, redesigned for **low-light, high-focus terminal environments**.

This project brings Night Owl's signature cool tones and soft contrasts to your favorite command-line tools, including:

- üêô `delta` ‚Äì Git diff viewer
- üê± `bat` ‚Äì Syntax-highlighting cat replacement
- üõÅ `k9s` ‚Äì Kubernetes TUI client
- üß¨ `fzf` ‚Äì Fuzzy finder with preview integration
- üîÆ `iterm2` ‚Äì Terminal emulator color scheme
- üß™ `tmux` ‚Äì Status line and pane border theming
- üöÄ `starship` ‚Äì Minimal prompt with semantic color cues

## üéØ Philosophy

> Night Owl is more than a theme ‚Äî it‚Äôs a workspace ritual.

- Optimized for **focus** and **clarity** in low-light environments
- Reduces eye strain without sacrificing syntax readability
- Carefully selected saturation and brightness levels per tool

## üîß Setup Instructions

### üîπ Quick Start (Optional)

A helper script is available for auto-installation of supported components:

```bash
./install.sh
```

This script:

- Installs each theme **only if the related tool is installed**
- Backs up your config file if it already exists
- Symlinks or copies the Night Owl config into proper location

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If you already have custom config for any tool, **review and merge manually**.
> Do **not run blindly** unless you're fully aware of the changes.

When in doubt: **install one tool at a time by following the steps below.**

---

### üêô delta

1. Copy `delta/night-owl-delta.ini` to `~/.config/delta/themes/night-owl.ini`
2. In `~/.gitconfig`, include the theme config:

   ```ini
   [include]
       path = ~/.config/delta/themes/night-owl.ini

   [delta]
       syntax-theme = "Night-Owl"
       features = "night-owl"
   ```

> ‚úÖ **Note:** Do **not** manually copy the `[delta "night-owl"]` block into `~/.gitconfig`.
> Use `[include]` instead to ensure full compatibility with delta's features mechanism.

```

This will:

To preview what would be removed without making changes:

```bash
